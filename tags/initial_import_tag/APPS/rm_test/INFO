Hi!

We are using the kame snap kame-20040405-freebsd49-snap.tgz with the patch patch.20040406 applied. We came across the ppid-problem in our current project and could not find a reason that the ppid changed its value along the way. To make sure we did not affect the sndrcvinfo structure in some other part of the code we tested it using a modified verion of the echo client/server from the UNIX network programming book, but got the same result. We attach the modified echo server/client and the makefile we have used.

The only value that seems to be transmitted correctly is 0, wich lead us to believe that it was an "endian" problem, so we tried using the ntohl/htonl-functions but still got the same result.

Thanks for your help and and your fast replies to our questions.
