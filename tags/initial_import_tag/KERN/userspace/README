The umem slab allocator used here is released under the CDDL v1.0 license.

--------------

--- Feb 24, 2010 ---

All you should have to do now is :
make

And to destroy everything:
make destroy

---

In the old system, in order to build, on Linux and Mac OS X:
make

On FreeBSD:
make MAKE=gmake

If you want to make changes to any files then rebuild, first do:
make destroy
 ...before doing the above.

Once this is complete, the build/user_lib directory will contain the necessary
libraries to build userspace applications.  For an example of how to build a
userspace application, see the file userspace_app.make .


NOTES
----------

On FreeBSD, if the slab allocator is giving your problems, try to
up the sysctl -w vm.max_proc_mmap value.
