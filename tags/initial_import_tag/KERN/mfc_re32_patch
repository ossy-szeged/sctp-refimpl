- fix sctp_ifn initial refcount issue (prevents deletion)
- fix a bug during cookie collision that prevented an
  association from coming up in a specific restart case.
- Fix it so the shutdown-pending flag gets removed (this is
  more for correctness then needed) when we enter shutdown-sent
  or shutdown-ack-sent states.
- Fix a bug that caused the receiver to sometimes NOT send
  a SACK when a duplicate TSN arrived. Without this fix
  it was possible for the association to fall down if the
- Deleted primary destination is also stored when SCTP_MOBILITY_BASE.
  (Previously, it is stored when only SCTP_MOBILITY_FASTHANDOFF)
- Fix a locking issue where we might call send_initiate_ack() and
  incorrectly state the lock held/not held. Also fix it so that
  when we release the lock the inp cannot be deleted on us.
- Add the debug option that can cause the stack to panic instead
  of aborting an assoc. This does not and should never show up
  in options but is useful for debugging unexpected aborts.
- Add cumack_log sent to track sending cumack information for
  the debug case where we are running a special log per assoc.
- Added extra () aroudn sctp_sbspace macro to avoid compile warnings.
