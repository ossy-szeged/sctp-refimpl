	* netinet/sctp_output.c: Fix to use ip6_use_deprecated 
	  sysctl variable to check for deprecated addresses.
 
	  Need to modify source selection algorithm to check 
	  for preferred (eg.  non-deprecated) addresses first, 
	  and then check for deprecated addresses only if a 
	  preferred address is unavailable.

	  addresses as per RFC 2462 and IPNG WG discussion.
	  Minor style fixes.
